# alien-attack
This is my first every game written in Python, using the PyGame module. This project taugth me a lot about object oriented programming, and just how useful it can be. 

## How to play

Use the left and right arrow keys to move your space ship and press the space bar to shoot. Every alien you hit will increase your score. Make sure not to let the aliens get to the bottom of the screen, otherwise your score will be reset to zero!
